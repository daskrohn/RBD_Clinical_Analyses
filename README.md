## Preparing files
* Age at onset (AAO) and age at diagnoses (AADx) provided by clinicians from each centre.   
* Time to converstion (TTC) is calculated for both AAO and AADx. If not converted, time since onset or diagnosis is used.  
* Date of last follow up used as indicated unless YEAR OF FOLLOW UP - YEAR OF BIRTH - YEAR OF RBD ONSET/DIAGNOSIS was negative. In this case, 2018 was used (last collected of clinical data).  
* Genotypes were collected from imputed GWAS data - only common variants were included (+ known variant N370S).
